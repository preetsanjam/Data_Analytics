# Probability vs Likelihood
In non-technical parlance, "likelihood" is usually a synonym for "probability," but in statistical usage there is a clear distinction in perspective. 

## Probability
Probability corresponds to finding the chance of something given a sample distribution of the data, while likelihood refers to finding the best distribution of the data given a particular value of some feature or some situation in the data.

Probability is the measure of a specific event or an outcome occurring. It is about possible results.

## Likelihood
Likelihood is applied when we want to increase the outcome of a specific event or an outcome occurring. It is about hypothesis.
