# Describe the difference between a classification task and a regression task

Both classification and regression tasks are examples of supervised machine learning algorithms. However, there are many differences between the two.

## Classification algorithm
In a classification task, we are supposed to predict discrete target variables (class labels) using independent features. We find a **decision boundary** that can separate the different classes in the target variable with the maximum possible separation.

Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score are used  to evaluate the performance of the classification algorithms.

**Examples** 
- Identifying if an email is spam
- Identifying if a customer will churn
- Sentiment analysis: Is feedback positive or negative?

**Types of classification algorithm**
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbours
- Supoort Vector Machine

## Regression algorithm
In the regression tasks, we are supposed to predict a continuous target variable using independent features. We try to find the best fit line which can represent the overall trend in the data.

Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared score and  Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are used to evaluate the performance of the regression algorithms.

**Examples**
- House price predicion
- Rainfall prediction
- Sales prediction

**Types of regression algorithm**
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Decision Trees for Regression
